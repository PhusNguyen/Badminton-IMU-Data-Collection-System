# Badminton IMU Data Collection System
Complete hardware and software solution for capturing badminton stroke data using IMU sensors. This repository contains everything needed to build the data collection system and generate the dataset.

## 🏸 Overview
The system consists of an ESP32-based sensor device that wirelessly transmits real-time IMU data to a Python server for processing, visualizaing and storage.
